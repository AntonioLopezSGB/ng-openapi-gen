ng-openapi-gen: An OpenAPI 3 code generator for Angular
---

This project is a NPM module that generates model interfaces and web service
clients from an [OpenApi 3](https://www.openapis.org/)
[specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
The generated classes follow the principles of
[Angular](https://angular.io/). The generated code is compatible with Angular 6+.

For a generator for [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md),
use [ng-swagger-gen](https://github.com/cyclosproject/ng-swagger-gen) instead.

`ng-openapi-gen` is still in early development stage, and is not yet
recommended for production.
